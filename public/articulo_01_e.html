            <p>
                As part of the construction of Section 7 of the Tren Maya, in 2023, a palatial complex was identified, dating possibly from the Early Classic (250 AD - 600 AD) to the Terminal Classic (800 AD - 1000 AD). To allow greater access for the population of Quintana
                Roo, it will be relocated for its comprehensive appreciation. This monumental task was carried out thanks to the coordination of Dr. Manuel E. Pérez Rivas, academic head of the Tren Maya Archaeological Salvage Project, along with the work
                of archaeologists, specialists from various disciplines, manual laborers, and skilled masons, as well as the support from the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH), INAH Quintana Roo Center, and the Secretariat of National
                Defense (SEDENA).
                <p>
                    The research and subsequent relocation carried out by the specialists, as mentioned by the field director of Section 7, Front 1, Diana K. Blancas Olvera, open up an opportunity to reinterpret Mexico's archaeological heritage. This approach integrates
                    modern architecture with the preservation of archaeological remains, valuing cultural heritage and allowing its socialization in urban contexts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The palatial complex, consisting of 16 registered monuments, was located on private land owned by Mr. Natividad Brambila, who supported the archaeologists in their research. It was situated near the town of González Ortega, at kilometer 25 of the Chetumal-Villahermosa
                    federal highway, in the municipality of Othón P. Blanco, in the state of Quintana Roo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Initially, during the prospecting stage—where the area is explored to determine the presence of monuments within the right of way—specialists from Section 7, Front 1, discovered a set of monuments that had remained hidden until then and initially appeared
                    to be of smaller size.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsequently, as part of the scientific work carried out by INAH, archaeologists Manuel U. Morales Ramírez, Andrea Avendaño Avelino, Jocelyn Ruiz Valera, Gustavo Ávalos Capetillo, Jorge Cruz Palma, and Luis A. García Pineda excavated the monuments during
                    the first half of 2023. They discovered that the structures belonged to a palatial complex with architectural influences from the Petén and Río Bec regions. As a result, the decision was made to preserve and relocate them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After the excavation, and recognizing the importance of the discovered monument complex, the palatial complex was reopened. This allowed for its full documentation, provided more information about the area, and ultimately initiated the relocation process.
                    Thus, the team of specialists—led by field directors Diana K. Blancas Olvera and Sonny M. Ojeda Gonzáles, along with archaeologists Luis A. García Pineda, Jocelyn Ruiz Valera, Gustavo Ávalos Capetillo, and Raúl S. Eb Dzib—worked diligently.
                    They were supported in the field by technicians Alfredo Fernández Aguas, Diego Álvarez Huchin, Luis A. Arcos Morales, and Elizabeth Gutiérrez Ramírez. The team dedicated seven months, spanning the second half of 2023 and the first
                    half of 2024, to fully uncover the palatial complex and initiate its relocation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    During these processes, and based on the architectural characteristics, the field directors suggest that various activities took place within the complex, such as the reuse of architectural elements. This is evident, for example, in the absence of walls
                    in the rooms located on the platform of Plaza 1. A possible residential use is indicated by the presence of benches with red pigment found in the center of one of the rooms. Additionally, public or religious activities may have been
                    conducted, as suggested by the presence of a circular altar located at the center of Plaza 2.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Thanks to the research efforts, eight burials and various objects were recorded, among which the most notable are: a green stone metate, complete vessels such as a plate from the Águila Naranja group, high-walled bowls from the Balanza group, a figurine
                    with anthropomorphic features carved in green stone, and various green stone and shell ornaments, among other materials. It is important to mention that the archaeological, architectural, and geographical documentation required a multidisciplinary
                    team of specialists, including architect Andy L. Segovia Balam, geomatics specialists Luis I. Guadarrama Velázquez and Moisés Araiza Gamboa, and Mario A. Copca Ortiz, who was responsible for processing the 3D models.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, for the relocation process, an alphanumeric code was assigned to each of the masonry blocks that make up the walls, marked using a mixture of lime and pigment. Subsequently, photogrammetric and laser scans of each wall were conducted, and a sketch
                    was created to record the spatial location of each element. Lastly, the masonry blocks were placed, and the walls were reconstructed according to their original length, width, and height, with the construction fill being set aside
                    for use during the reassembly and consolidation phase.
                </p>
                <h2>A Palatial Complex Yet to Be Studied</h2>
                <p>
                    The field directors of the archaeological work, based on the ceramic material found, believe that the complex was occupied during the Early Classic period (250 AD – 600 AD) and the Terminal Classic period (800 AD – 1000 AD). This occupation is also associated
                    with the architectural styles of the Petén and Río Bec regions. Furthermore, specialists suggest that the continuous renovations and construction phases observed within the complex indicate a sustained occupation. This long-term use
                    influenced the site's spatial configuration and led to the reuse or dismantling of architectural elements by the ancient Maya.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is no doubt about the importance that the construction of the Tren Maya has had in archaeological research in the south of the country. This project reinforces the commitment of INAH and the INAH Quintana Roo Center to the exploration of previously
                    unknown areas and to sharing our cultural heritage with the entire world, and most importantly, with the people of Mexico.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is important to mention that this effort has been a collaboration between SEDENA and INAH, along with the participation of other institutions such as the Government of the State of Quintana Roo, the State Agency for Strategic Projects of Quintana Roo
                    (AGEPRO), and BIENESTAR. Their contributions have supported the progress of the archaeological salvage work and, subsequently, the relocation efforts. Additionally, they have provided the necessary space for placing the masonry blocks
                    and stones of the monuments selected for restoration.
