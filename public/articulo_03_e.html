            <p>
                The findings from the Archaeological Salvage of the Maya Train vary in size and shape. In addition to structures, some discoveries consist solely of objects. However, these objects provide us with important information to expand our knowledge of Maya
                culture. This is the case with the discoveries made in Section 6, Front 5 of the Maya Train. Dr. Manuel Eduardo Pérez Rivas' team was transferred near the communities of Chacchoben and Limones, Quintana Roo, to carry out the necessary
                excavations and investigations related to the discovery.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Archaeological Salvage team, composed of personnel from the National Institute of Anthropology and History, the INAH Quintana Roo Center, and personnel from the Secretariat of National Defense, conducted two excavation areas to study the archaeological
                remains. The first excavation area, known as Sabanitas, revealed several traces of the daily life of the ancient Maya. In this excavation, foundations, "chich" mounds, platforms, and defensive walls were found.
            </p>
            <p>
                What is unique about these monuments are the objects found within them. For example, the T6_26021 monument is a foundation where fragments of striated ceramic were found, specifically necks of pots. This discovery adds to a specific group of findings
                in the Maya region, as it is not the only place where pot necks have been detected.
            </p>
            <p>
                The designation T6_20035 corresponds to another monument, specifically a "chich" mound. These mounds are circular domestic structures that served as the bases for light constructions or bird pens. This "chich" mound contained a fragment of a ceramic pot
                in red and cream colors inside.
            </p>
            <p>
                The presence of ceramic elements was a constant in these excavations. To the south of Sabanitas, a small-sized platform named T6_20016 was found, in which a ceramic bowl was discovered. In another platform, T6_20019, a fragment of a ceramic figurine was
                found. It is believed that it might have had an anthropomorphic shape.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to the ceramics, lithic elements were also present in the excavations. The T6_26021 monument corresponds to a foundation where bifacial tools made of flint, debitage, and a hammerstone were found. The presence of these objects in a single
                foundation suggests to the archaeologists that this site may have been a knapping area at some point. In another foundation, T6_20018, a bifacial tool and a projectile point, both made of flint, were discovered.
            </p>
            <p>
                The other excavation area, known as La Estación, also revealed traces of daily life but presented a particular situation for the archaeologists, as a greater human activity was observed there. Firstly, it was located near the town of Limones, and secondly,
                there is the presence of private properties adjacent to the area.
            </p>
            <p>
                This situation led to some monuments showing signs of deterioration. For example, the T6_06009 platform was damaged by heavy machinery. Despite this, a type of stone metate known as a "pileta" was found at the platform. The metate was designated as T6_06001,
                a movable monument. Another monument affected by human activity is the T6_10004 foundation. Nonetheless, a ceramic polisher and an ornamental object were located within it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, but no less important, the T6_10005 monument corresponds to a structure possibly intended for beekeeping. This conclusion was suggested due to the presence of three objects: a grinding stone and two lids. These objects, made of limestone, closely
                resemble those used in the raising of meliponas, the stingless bees native to the Maya region. This activity is still practiced today in various places within the Maya area, indicating that this labor is an ancient tradition.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thanks to the Archaeological Salvage of the Maya Train, the work of the specialists from INAH, the INAH Quintana Roo Center, and the personnel from the Secretariat of National Defense, it is possible to learn about the daily life of the ancient Maya and
                strengthen ties by appreciating ancient traditions.
